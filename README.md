# YDKList
.YDK files are Yu-Gi-Oh! card lists generated by YGOPro containing cards serial numbers.
YDKList parses YDK files and searches on third-party databases (http://www.yugiohprices.com/ and http://yugioh.wikia.com/) for more information (including price on online marketplaces) about each card serial number.
